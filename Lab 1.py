# I noticed that most of the players are of age 20-30. Once players turn 30, there are fewer and fewer players.There aren't a single player that is of the age 45.I also noticed that there aren't a lot of players younger than 20,without no player being younger than 15.

corrMatrix


# A positive correlation is the Age to the Overall score, this makes sense because I assume as a player gets older they get more experience and become a better player their score would go up. A negative correlation is the Age to the Potential Score, this makes sense because as a player gets older their potential to do well lowers..A column I would use as input is Age because one's Age will determine their performance.A column I would use as a target is potential because as they get to a certain age their potetional will rise but once they also reach a certain age their body will get old and their poteional will decrease.
